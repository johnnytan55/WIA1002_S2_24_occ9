My name is Tan Hao Wen with matrix number, 23004923. I am majoring in Artificial Intelligence. This is my first/second/third (specify) time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because I feel like it will be harder than FOP.
I acquired B- for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will practice java codes every day. Wish me luck!!! Thursday, 18 June 2021
